# oshaR

oshaR is a convenient method of pulling OSHA IMIS data directly into an R dataframe for analysis. This package is very much in development, and this tool is not even publish-worthy data to begin with. It is strongly suggested that you check results against the IMIS site itself 

The Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) was designed as an information resource for in-house use by OSHA staff and management, and by state agencies which carry out federally-approved OSHA programs.

The Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) is designed and administered as a management tool for OSHA to help it direct its resources. When IMIS is put to new or different uses, the data should be verified by reference to the case file and confirmed by the appropriate federal or state office. Employers or employees who believe a particular IMIS entry to be inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date are encouraged to contact the OSHA field office or state plan agency which originated the entry.
